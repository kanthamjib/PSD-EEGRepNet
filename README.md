# PSD-EEGRepNet: A CNN Architecture with Multi-Branch RepBlocks for Power Spectral Density-Based Motor Imagery EEG Classification in BCI

**(left blank for a picture)**

**PSD-EEGRepNet** is a lightweight CNN-based neural network architecture utilizing RepBlocks designed specifically for Motor Imagery (MI) EEG signal classification. The model leverages Power Spectral Density (PSD) features, efficiently extracted using Welch's method, to classify EEG signals into distinct motor imagery tasks.

The primary goal of PSD-EEGRepNet is to `achieve robust classification accuracy while maintaining low computational complexity during model training and inference`. It is particularly optimized for use in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, providing a good balance between performance and computational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Design**: Lightweight multi-branch convolutional architecture inspired by RepVGG.

- **PSD-Based Features**: Uses Welchâ€™s method for extracting Power Spectral Density features.

- **High Performance**: Evaluated with cross-validation showing promising accuracy on PhysioNet datasets.

- **Rapid Training**: Quick training times make iterative model development straightforward.

## Experimental Results

PSD-EEGRepNet was evaluated on the PhysioNet Motor Imagery dataset comprising EEG data from 10 subjects. Using a 5-fold stratified cross-validation scheme and two different data overlap conditions (80% and 90%), the model demonstrated:

**Accuracy**:

- 80.38% (80% data overlap)

- 85.69% (90% data overlap)

**Model Complexity**:

- Parameters: ~6.32 million

- Computational Cost: ~20 MFLOPs

**Training Efficiency**:

- Average training time per fold: 8.8 seconds (80% overlap), 20.4 seconds (90% overlap)

These results underline the potential of PSD-EEGRepNet as a practical and efficient solution for EEG-based motor imagery classification tasks.
